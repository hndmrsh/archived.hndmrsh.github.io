Notes:
======

First GGJ in Wellington
Excellent experience
Wonderfully run! Thanks to organizers etc.

FRONT-MATTER -> see-also: (link to game)


Positives:
----------
- successfully finished a game!
- got to meet people, sense of community
- networking? (met people who I might be able to work with later)

Negatives:
----------
- skill distribution - too many devs, didn't know how to collaborate with others using Unity
 - worked this out eventually (don't use the scene file, make everything prefabs)
- having a team full of newbies/wildly differing abilities and experience levels
- overly ambitious
- not building an MVP first and play testing
 - this also meant not everyone was on the same page until we had a playable build at the end of the second day.
 - also meant motivation suffered because started to doubt the fun of the game before the game had been built.
