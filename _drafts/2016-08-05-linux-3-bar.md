==========================

- Desired features:
  - workspaces
  - current window title (maybe? might not be necessary)
  - RAM usage/free
  - CPU usage/free
  - networking stats
  - HDD stats
  - uptime
  - redshift colour temp
    - redshift -p 2> /dev/null | awk "NR==3"| cut -d ':' -f 2 | tr -d ' '
  - package update status
    - e.g. "4 packages to update"
  - currently playing song (if any)
  - "TV on/off" status
    - Clicking this should toggle the TV on (duplicate of second monitor) and audio routed through HDMI to TV
  - current date/time (with calendar dropdown)
  - trash can and item count
  - some form of notification centre? Not sure if/how this works in Linux, so this can be done later.
  - some form of system tray (drop down)
  - Asana task list ("2 tasks today (3 overdue)")
- I have two monitors so let's split this into two separate bars
  - bar1:
    - workspaces
    - current window title
    - current date/time (with calendar dropdown)
  - bar2:
    - current song
    - everything else
- In Openbox though, window title should be replaced with open window icons and their minimized/active state
  - Alternative: maybe the workspaces and window icons are replaced? So I have one bar which contains all windows of all workspaces, e.g.:
    Z: (c) (a) X: (c) N: (n)
    - Also, the background of the current workspace block in the bar would be coloured to indicate that it is current; and if the current workspace has no windows, it shows up in its right place when you are viewing it, e.g.:
    Z:(c)(a)  X:  N:(n)

==========================

- Going to define everything I want as functions, and call them in the order I want inside one or many echo calls

- Clock
  - easy - just use the date command and pass in a format
- Workspaces
  - Use obxprop to get valuable information, and parse with grep/sed/etc to get information
  - Write a simple function to parse xprops - return the RHS of the equals sign for properties matching a given arg
  - Extract workspace names as a list, iterate over them and print them out
  - To set background of current workspace, get the cardinal value of the current desktop, and set background of that to
  a tinted colour (just use black for now - until my colour scheme system is set up)
  - Need to somehow render \_NET_WM_ICON also (or maybe just use text representation of applications?)
  - Define array of window "icons" (using first letter of window title) indexed by desktop number
    - For each window in desktop, append to string of that desktop
  - Output this array after each desktop label
    - Sidenote: this was getting complicated so I created a debug function to output to stderr
  - Also want to tint the background of the active window icon
    - Use root xprop \_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW to find the active ID, and tint the background of this ID while iterating
  - Now, only show desktops with windows on them
    - Do this by checking for an empty array index in the WINDOWS array
- System stats
  - Thought this would be easy - oops
  - Using sysstat to make life easier
  - Inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229333/how-to-get-overall-cpu-usage-e-g-57-on-linux
  - Use printf to format the output for the CPU
  - Now work out myself how to do the same for RAM
  - Use free -h, and parse output with awk
    - No wait, that's dumb, we want consistent units; use free -b to always output in bytes (most accurate)
  - Can't work out how to get network speeds with built-in commands, so installing iftop to deal with it.
- Redshift
  - Parsed output of redshift -p and displayed
  - Will add an click action here later to enable/disable using my redshiftctl script
- Uptime
  - uptime -p
  - if the substring starting after "up " is empty, just print "0 minutes" (because uptime prints just "up" if the machine has been up less than 1 minute)
  - Otherwise, pretty print it out (without the prefixed "up ")
- HDD stats
  - ????????????????????????????????????????
- Networking
  - ????????????????????????????????????????
- Packages
  - ????????????????????????????????????????
- Current song
  - ????????????????????????????????????????
- Trash
  - ????????????????????????????????????????
- TV status
  - Can see how many displays are connected and turned on by grepping each line for XxY+DXxDY
  - xrandr | grep "[0-9]\+x[0-9]\++[0-9]\++[0-9]\+"
  - Count the lines: if there are 3 lines, the TV is on; else, the TV is off
  - Except xrandr is actually causing my entire PC to briefly freeze. Need to work out a better way of doing this
- Notification centre
  - ????????????????????????????????????????
- Sys tray
  - ????????????????????????????????????????
- Asana
  - Retrieved Personal Access Key from Asana
  - Set environment variable for key
  - The Asana API is really poorly designed:
    - Can't specify completed status, so have to use "completed_since=now" - that's crazy
    - Also can't seem to filter by due date - so will have to do this manually! :/
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_KEY" "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks?assignee=me&workspace=498346170860&completed_since=now&opt_fields=name,due_on&opt_pretty" will give me what I need.
  - Can compare dates like this: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/84381/how-to-compare-two-dates-in-a-shell
    - Grepped dates using: grep -o "[0-9]\+-[0-9]\+-[0-9]\+"
    - if [ $(date -d $d +%s) -lt $(date +%s) ]; then
          let "count++"
      fi
  - Perfect! But, can't run this every second (obviously); so going to disable this one until I set up separate sleep cycles for each block



- Something here is causing my CPU to work really hard while rendering the bar, so I need to work that out!
  - It's the calls to obxprop, I think
  - Disabled that to dev the rest of the bar
