- Bought Pi Zero and Pi TFT 3.5" Plus
- Attached screen
- Installed RetroPie 4.0 RC1 on a 16GB microSD
- First boot - backlight works, good sign!
- Now need to make the screen my primary output so I don't need to use HDMI out
- Keymap is GB! Grr, need to fix this so I can use my normal-person's US keyboard
  - edited the /etc/default/keyboard file, rebooted
- Setting up wifi was a pain
  - https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=7592
  - Added a bunch of stuff into /etc/network/interfaces (using vi, which was hard)
  - WORKS!
  - Probably could have done this through the RetroPie interface, but where's the fun in that...
- Following this guide: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-3-dot-5-touch-screen-for-raspberry-pi/easy-install
  - Install and run kernel patch script
  - Installed without any problems - nice. Didn't even take 20 minutes!
  - Console output now mapped to the TFT screen
- Need to set EmulationStation to output to TFT screen
  - Discovered this page at this point: https://learn.adafruit.com/running-opengl-based-games-and-emulators-on-adafruit-pitft-displays/retropie-setup
  - SCP'd over an NES ROM - test this running over HDMI first
