- Installed oh-my-zsh, but all the colours are weird, and there are symbols missing. Need to solve that later.
- Trying to use BURG to customize the GRUB bootloader
  - Not sure about compatibility with Arch, but it's still in AUR, so I'm going to install it anyway and hope for the best
  - make backup of /boot/grub and /etc/grub.d


Start of actual ricing:
-----------------------

- Installing herbstluftwm to try
  - seems powerful, but even steeper learning curve than i3!
  - managed to start floating mode ("herbstclient floating") and worked out how to move/resize windows using the mouse, so at least it's "usable" now
  - following the tutorial:
    - installed dzen2 - great, now I have a panel
    - copied /etc/xdg/herbstluftwm/autostart to ~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart
    - uncommented the hc detect_monitors and Mod4 line
    - reading through the file, learnt a few keybindings which help me to navigate hlwm (incl. Mod+tab to cycle frames, Mod+Backspace to cycle monitors, Mod+1..9 to change tags within the monitor, Mod+arrows to focus windows, Mod+r to remove... etc etc etc etc)
	- FIRST SCREENSHOT!
    - replaced "xsetroot" line with "feh --bg-scale $HOME/pictures/<...>" line
	- SECOND SCREENSHOT
    - happy with how hlwm is set up for now, let's set something else up!

- Created ~/dotfiles directory where I will keep all my configuration files. I symlink to them from the expected locations (e.g. ~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart -> ~/dotfiles/herbstluftwm-autostart) so that I can use git to manage my rices better.
  - uncommented the ZSH_CUSTOM line from .zshrc (generated by .oh-my-zsh) to point at dotfiles
    - ZSH_CUSTOM=$HOME/dotfiles



- Installing burg
  - Finally built it from AUR after installing a million more dependencies
  - burg-install /dev/sdc, burg-mkconfig -o /boot/burg/burg.cfg
  - Downloaded a custom theme from http://sworiginal.deviantart.com/art/Lightness-for-burg-181461810
  - update-burg along the way
  - after realising that it was starting on my TV, I got it working by changing the resolution (?)
  - working! But need to remove the MBRs from old hard drives
    - Will try this through Windows


Todo
----
- move Desktop & Downloads to a shared drive so I can access them from both
- swap urxvt for termite
- emoji keyboard input
- status bar (lemonbar/yabar)
- menu to switch open windows
- conky in status bar
  - redshift status!
- rofi for opening apps
