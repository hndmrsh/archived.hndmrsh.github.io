- Installed oh-my-zsh, but all the colours are weird, and there are symbols missing. Need to solve that later.
- Trying to use BURG to customize the GRUB bootloader
  - Not sure about compatibility with Arch, but it's still in AUR, so I'm going to install it anyway and hope for the best
  - make backup of /boot/grub and /etc/grub.d 
- Installing herbstluftwm to try
  - seems powerful, but even steeper learning curve than i3!
  - managed to start floating mode ("herbstclient floating") and worked out how to move/resize windows using the mouse, so at least it's "usable" now
  - following the tutorial:
    - installed dzen2 - great, now I have a panel
    - copied /etc/xdg/herbstluftwm/autostart to ~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart
    - uncommented the hc detect_monitors and Mod4 line
    - reading through the file, learnt a few keybindings which help me to navigate hlwm (incl. Mod+tab to cycle frames, Mod+Backspace to cycle monitors, Mod+1..9 to change tags within the monitor, Mod+arrows to focus windows, Mod+r to remove... etc etc etc etc)
	- FIRST SCREENSHOT!
    - replaced "xsetroot" line with "feh --bg-scale $HOME/pictures/<...>" line
	- SECOND SCREENSHOT


Part 2: Ricing
--------------
- Initialise a git repository in ~/dotfiles so I can keep "themes" in separate branches


Todo
----

- status bar (lemonbar/yabar)
- menu to switch open windows
