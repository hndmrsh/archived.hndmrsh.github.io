_trapped._ is my entry into [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) #23, the ten-year anniversary of one of the world’s biggest game jams. The theme was “Tiny World”.

Due to time constraints, this game was created in a grand total of 11 hours. The game was developed in pure Java (it only uses the JLayer library for playing the mp3). The following is a description of the game as taken from my LD23 entry page:

>trapped. is an arena-style platform game with a quasi-retro aesthetic. You are trapped in a tiny world, with its inhabitants out to get you. Survive as long as you can.
>
>Use WASD to move around, and aim/fire using the mouse. Create your own levels by making a copy of the map_template.map file in the trapped/maps/ directory, and editing it with a text editor. Please see the included README file for more information.
