This is a game developed by a team of three software engineering and computer science students and three visual design students for a third-year university 3D game design course. The game was made using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and runs using the Blender Game Engine.

Unfortunately, the game only runs on Windows at the moment, and requires a gamepad (such as a Microsoft Xbox 360 controller).
