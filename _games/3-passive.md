Four months after my first [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) entry, _Passive_ is my second attempt at making a game over a weekend, and my first attempt at a group jam. After limited progress over the first 48 hours of the 72-hour jam, we flew through the remaining time at an incredible pace, resulting in a polished and genuinely fun (!) game.

The game was developed using the Slick framework for Java, which utilises the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL). None of the members of our team had used the framework before, which resulted in a few issues, but development was otherwise smooth.
