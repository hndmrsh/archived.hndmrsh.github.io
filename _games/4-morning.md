This was my first attempt at developing a 3D game on my own. It is also my first proper game in Unity. What's more, it was my first attempt at proper 3D modelling with Blender. (I've used both Unity and Blender before, but in a very limited capacity). For this reason, I am super proud of what I managed to achieve in a short amount of time.

Unfortunately, the scope of this project was far too great for a 72-hour jam, and I ran out of time to develop much content. As it stands, the entire game can be completed in a couple of minutes - there's lots of text in the game for various events, so I'd recommend taking 10 minutes to explore all the objects in the room, especially in the various different game states.

I had a lot of great ideas for what I wanted this game to be, and I'm still keen on following through on them - I'll continue working on this game in the near future and turn it into a proper post-LD game.

_2016 update:_ I still have the plans for this game in the back of my mind, and my aim is to eventually release my original vision for this game, time and enthusiasm allowing.
