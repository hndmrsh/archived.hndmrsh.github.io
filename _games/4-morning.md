Morning is the title of my third entry into Ludum Dare, the worldwide game jam. This was a solo entry, targeting the 72-hour Jam. It is a 3D, first-person point-and-click adventure game (in the vein of Myst, for example). Given the time constraints, there’s not a lot of content in the game – the aim of the game at the moment is to guide the character through his morning routine so he can go to work.

This game is my first solo attempt at developing a 3D game, and I’m rather proud of how much I was able to achieve given my novice status. Morning was developed in Unity, scripted in UnityScript with MonoDevelop, modelled in Blender, and audio’d in sfxr and Audacity.

_2016 update:_ I still have the plans for this game in the back of my mind, and my aim is to eventually release my original vision for this game, time and enthusiasm allowing.
