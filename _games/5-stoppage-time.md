My fourth overall and third solo entry into  [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/), Stoppage Time is a football strategy game. The game is influenced by Mode 7’s [Frozen Synapse](http://www.frozensynapse.com/). The gameplay and controls are listed on the entry page – if you’re unfamiliar with Frozen Synapse, it’s an essential read (the UI is also kind of unintuitive so you’ll probably need to read it regardless).

I did not intend on participating in this Ludum Dare, as I was away on a snowboarding trip for the first 28 hours. However, when I got home, sore and tired, I realized that the theme (“10 Seconds”) was perfect for an idea I had in the backlog – and so I got to work. The night before the close of the jam I came very close to giving up – I didn’t think I had a chance of finishing the game in time! Thankfully I persevered, as I was able to get a completely working prototype done and submitted on time.
