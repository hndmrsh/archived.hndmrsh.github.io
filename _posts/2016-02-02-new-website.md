Welcome to my new website! There is more to come, as I finish designing and implementing many of the pages and transferring over the bulk of content from other sources. Many of the links are currently non-functional for the moment also, including the share, search, and tags functions. Launching in this way allows me to start blogging immediately, rather than waiting to perfect the experience.

The site is hosted on GitHub; I will be making a Software post later with links to the source, as well as a blog post on my experieces working with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

There are a lot of bugs and issues at the moment, so bear with me!
